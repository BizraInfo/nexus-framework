# NEXUS Framework

Next-Generation Autonomous Tool Orchestration Framework

## Overview

NEXUS is a sophisticated multi-agent system architecture designed to orchestrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools across domains. The framework implements a three-layer architecture:

1. **Foundation Layer** - Core infrastructure including knowledge graph schema, repository structures, and filesystem organization
2. **Integration Layer** - Workflow pipelines connecting different tool domains
3. **Automation Layer** - Autonomous processes enabling self-improving capabilities

## Architecture

The NEXUS framework consists of several specialized agents coordinated by an Executive Function component:

- **Executive Function** - Meta-cognitive planning system implementing OODA loops
- **Knowledge Agent** - Manages knowledge graph and ontology development
- **Research Agent** - Gathers information from diverse sources
- **Development Agent** - Handles code and repository management
- **Content Agent** - Creates and organizes documentation
- **Analytics Agent** - Processes data and performs numerical analysis

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Layer (Current)
- Knowledge Graph Schema
- Repository Structure Standardization
- Filesystem Organization

### Phase 2: Integration Layer
- Research-to-Knowledge Pipeline
- Knowledge-to-Development Pipeline
- Analysis-to-Documentation Pipeline

### Phase 3: Automation Layer
- Project Initialization Automation
- Continuous Knowledge Enrichment
- Advanced Integration Patterns

## Getting Started

The NEXUS Framework is currently in Phase 1 of implementation. Stay tuned for more documentation and code as the project develops.
