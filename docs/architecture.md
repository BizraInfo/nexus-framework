# NEXUS Framework Architecture

## System Overview

The NEXUS Framework is designed as a multi-agent system for orchestrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools across various domains. It implements a three-layer architecture that provides increasing levels of automation and intelligence.

## Architectural Layers

### Foundation Layer

The Foundation Layer establishes the core infrastructure components:

- **Knowledge Graph Schema**: Defines entity types, relation taxonomies, and observation structures
- **Repository Structure**: Standardizes code organization and project templates
- **Filesystem Organization**: Creates consistent directory hierarchies and metadata standards

### Integration Layer

The Integration Layer implements workflow pipelines that connect different tool domains:

- **Research-to-Knowledge Pipeline**: Converts web research into structured knowledge entities
- **Knowledge-to-Development Pipeline**: Translates knowledge into development tasks and code
- **Analysis-to-Documentation Pipeline**: Transforms analysis results into comprehensive documentation

### Automation Layer

The Automation Layer provides autonomous processes that reduce human intervention:

- **Project Initialization Automation**: Automates the setup of new projects
- **Continuous Knowledge Enrichment**: Automatically expands the knowledge base
- **Advanced Integration Patterns**: Implements recursive self-improvement and predictive workflows

## Agent Components

The NEXUS Framework consists of specialized agent modules:

### Executive Function

The Executive Function serves as the meta-cognitive planning system:

- Implements OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) loops for continuous optimization
- Utilizes backward chaining for goal decomposition
- Employs forward chaining for execution planning

### Knowledge Agent

The Knowledge Agent manages structured information:

- Creates and maintains the knowledge graph
- Implements ontology management and semantic querying
- Performs automatic knowledge extraction from unstructured data

### Research Agent

The Research Agent gathers information from diverse sources:

- Performs web searches and content retrieval
- Implements contextual filtering and relevance assessment
- Validates information across multiple sources

### Development Agent

The Development Agent handles code and repository operations:

- Manages GitHub repositories and code modifications
- Implements automated PR and issue workflows
- Performs code analysis and quality assessment

### Content Agent

The Content Agent creates and organizes documentation:

- Generates structured content in multiple formats
- Maintains consistency across documentation
- Synchronizes documentation with code changes

### Analytics Agent

The Analytics Agent processes data and performs analysis:

- Executes mathematical calculations and statistical models
- Implements temporal and dimensional transformations
- Generates insights from numerical data

## Communication Protocol

Agents communicate through a standardized protocol that includes:

- Source and destination identifiers
- Structured data payloads
- Context information
- Temporal metadata

This communication framework enables coordinated operations across multiple agents and tools.
